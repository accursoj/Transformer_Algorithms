ETDataSets
ETDataSets has 4 datasets. ETTm1 and ETTm2 are data sets from two provinces in China. ETTh1 and ETTh2 are collected from the same provinces but instead of it being collected every 15 minutes, their data is collected every hour.
This dataset has one class, which is the Oil Temperature. This is a regression problem because of the continuous quantitative data it has. 
H1 and H2 deals with less values than M1 and M2 because of how frequent data is collected.  
Data collected from province II shows higher Oil temp which we can use to compare it to load capacity of their dataset.
Province I: ETTm1
(x,y) = (date, Oil Temp(OT))
o	Data is plotted every 15 minutes for a whole year
DATA: ETTm1_Overall
